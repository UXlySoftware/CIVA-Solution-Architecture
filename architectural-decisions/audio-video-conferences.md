## Where to use AllPeep

AllPeep is using livekit as their backend.

### Why use them

1. added more tools on top of livekit frontend components
2. self-hosted livekit
3. they can built react components if needed

### Whey not use them

1. livekit already has react, android, ios components in place and have a strong support
2. AllPeep is hosting and managing the open-source version. But CIVA will need to pay AllPeep to manage the conference servers. LiveKit also has a managed service which will be cheaper and more reliable as they are experts in those.
3. Integration with AllPeep will be just an extra layer of authentication and point of failure.
4. Did not feel like they have a strong engineering team to support CIVA's growth.
